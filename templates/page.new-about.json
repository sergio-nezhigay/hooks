Fragile metal hooks had snapped under the weight, leaving jagged edges that tore through fabric—and sometimes even skin. Concerned about his son’s learning environment, Eli sought a safer solution and discovered Toughook. When the school dismissed his recommendation, Eli was undeterred. Driven to bring these durable, child-safe hooks to the U.S., he connected with Toughook UK, partnering with them to become their exclusive U.S. distributor. Since 2006, Toughook has helped keep schools organized and safe, with its products trusted by customers worldwide.<br/></p>",
